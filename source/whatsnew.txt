=====================
new mc_InitMercury( cFile_Include ). It's the same as MercuryInclude() but this function, apart from 
loading the mercury include, initializes more functions, such as error handling. Any initialization 
of mercury will always go through here and we will not have to touch the code anymore.
See samples/index.prg:

//	{% mh_LoadHrb( '../lib/mercury.hrb' ) %}		// Load Mercury lib
//	{% mc_InitMercury( '../lib/mercury.ch' ) %}		// Init Mercury system
